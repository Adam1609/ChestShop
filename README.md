# ChestShop
ChestShop for PocketMine-MP (pmmp) by Muqsit. Note that you must have **EconomyAPI** installed before running the plugin, else the plugin won't enable.
Chest shop allows you to create Chest GUI based shops - a widely used feature in minigames such as MoneyWars, SkyBlock and SkyWars.

Features:
- Ability to add enchanted, custom named, custom NBT tagged items.
- Everything can be managed in-game on run time. No config modification needed.
- Two papers, named "Turn Left" and "Turn Right" are located at the end of the GUI to switch pages.
- ChestGUI (block and inventory) is only sent to the command issuer. The GUI tile block is unbreakable, making it impossible for anyone to duplicate the chest contents.
- Usage of custom chest tiles and inventories rather than bulk events for performance.
